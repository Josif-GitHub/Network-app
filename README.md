## Testing 

- I have tested the functionality of the web application on three browsers.
  - Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
- I have included elements of action and reaction for:
  - Anchor links, buttons, navbar(dropdowns), search, carousel(images/control/indicators), modal, radio-button, checkbox, text fields for comments in form, font:hover (text, icons, and more), I have tested that the required fields in the form reacts visually when trying to submit and it's empty and they complain as expected, responsive design when width is altered. 
  - I have tested their functionality and I have reached the conclusion that everything works fine, according to expectations. 
  - I have tested all navbar links in various screen sizes and additional features within each page also in various screen sizes. 
- It looks really good on various screen sizes and feels good as well. I have not reacted on any differences between various screens, it feels normal.
- The burgers menu moves to a new row when the width becomes too narrow. Another note that I discovered at the end is that with a narrower screen size, a nested container moves to the side and it looks strange, but that is because the contents of it are wider than the parent's container. This phenomenon can be found on the page for activities / events under the network. The clickable link protrudes on the right side when the parent container becomes too narrow. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) except minor things on contact.html, see below.

  - Files tested:
    - template.html
