# Lyftet i Lövgärdet    

Lyftet i Lövgärdet is a network of several organizations, associations and civil inhabitants that work together to help the community in a certain suburb called "Lövgärdet" to be uplifted to a higher standard of living in that area for the inhabitants. 

The aim of this network "Lyftet i Lövgärdet" is to remove this suburb from the polices list of "Exposed Suburbs" in the country through spreding information to the community and facilitating some needs of the inhabitants through diffrent activities and events. 

Among these are tutoring / homework help for children in school, so that more people have good opportunities for further education, enable associations to use municipal premises for sports and cultural activities, but also to spread necessary knowledge to residents about for example the Corona pandemic and the Covid-19 virus, etc.

The audience of the website will be targeted towards inhabitants who lives in the suburb and who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves involved and / or informed about. Lyftet i Lövgärdet will be useful for inhabitants to see exactly when and where they should be to organize / join the activities. It will also be useful for facilitating communication between different associations that want to achieve common goals.
